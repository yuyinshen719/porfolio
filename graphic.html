    <h2>My graphic design works:</h2>
    <p>Design is the creation of a plan or convention for the construction of an object, system or measurable human interaction. Design has different connotations in different fields (see design disciplines below). In some cases, the direct construction of an object (as in pottery, engineering, management, coding, and graphic design) is also considered to use design thinking.

    Designing often necessitates considering the aesthetic, functional, economic, and sociopolitical dimensions of both the design object and design process. It may involve considerable research, thought, modeling, interactive adjustment, and re-design. Meanwhile, diverse kinds of objects may be designed, including clothing, graphical user interfaces, products, skyscrapers, corporate identities, business processes, and even methods or processes of designing.

    Thus "design" may be a substantive referring to a categorical abstraction of a created thing or things (the design of something), or a verb for the process of creation as is made clear by grammatical context. Colour expert Pantone has chosen a peachy orange shade named Living Coral, or Pantone 16-1546, as its colour of the year for 2019.

    <br><br>Announced today, 6 December, the Living Coral colour is described by Pantone as an "animating and life-affirming coral hue with a golden undertone that energises and enlivens with a softer edge".

    "Sociable and spirited, the engaging nature of Pantone 16-1546 Living Coral welcomes and encourages lighthearted activity," said the company. The colour is also said to reference the nourishing impact of coral on sea life, as well as the "devastating" effect of today's society on the environment.

    Pantone announces a colour of the year every December, based on trend-forecasting research from the Pantone Colour Institute.

    The colour is chosen based on "what is taking place in our global culture at a moment in time". According to the brand, Living Coral is already being spotted on catwalks in fashion shows, as well as on social media. "Colour is an equalising lens through which we experience our natural and digital realities and this is particularly true for Living Coral," said Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Colour Institute.

    "With consumers craving human interaction and social connection, the humanising and heartening qualities displayed by the convivial Pantone Living Coral hit a responsive chord," she continued.

    The Pantone Colour Institute has been choosing a colour of the year since 1999. Last year, a vibrant purple shade was chosen, and in 2017, a zesty shade of green called Greenery. In 2016, Pantone picked two soft colours â€“ a baby blue and dusty pink.

    The colours are often bold in tone. Other recent examples include the purply pink Radiant Orchid announced for 2014, and the bright orange Tangerine Tango in 2012.</p>
