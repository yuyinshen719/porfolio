        <h2>CHI Student Competition Project</h2>
        <p>Student-athletes usually experience psychological issues during their injured period, which play important roles in their rehabilitation. The three major challenges are loss of identity, isolation, and inability to understand and communicate their recovery progress between checkups. To assist the injured athletes, we propose AthleteJuvo, a collaborative gaming solution incorporating routine rehabilitation exercises, team competition, and social supports. Specifically, AthleteJuvo utilizes the competitive nature of athletes to gamify the rehabilitation process. Athletes rebuild their identity by forming a team with other injured athletes to compete with their rival schools. AthleteJuvo also helps injured athletes meet nearby injured athletes and connect back with their non-injured team members by sending challenges. To aid in recovery, AthleteJuvo uses wearable sensing fabric which collect and report movement data to the athlete’s therapist.</p>
        <h2>Problem Overview</h2>
        <h3>Injury is 1% physical and 99% psychological</h3>
        <p>For student athletes, getting injured is not only about physical influence but also psychologically and socially. Since most of an athlete’s daily schedule is team-centered, once they get injured, they miss the social interactions they would have had otherwise. Without their regular training and practice, athletes also miss the element of competition in their lives.
        The key problems we aim to solve include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The isolation and the feeling of uselessness during the injured period</li>
                <li>The inconvenient methods of getting advice from athletes with similar experience</li>
                <li>The inability to understand their rehab progress</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p>To understand the problems injured athletes encountered in a broader sense, we conducted an online survey where the access was limited to injured athletes only; and held semi-structured interviews, including expert interviews and interviews with injured athletes.</p>
